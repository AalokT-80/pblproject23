            <p class="container2">
                Civil engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of 
                infrastructure such as buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and water supply systems. Civil engineers are 
                responsible for ensuring that these structures are safe, efficient, and sustainable.The work of civil engineers 
                involves the use of principles of mathematics, physics, and mechanics to design and analyze structures. They also 
                use computer-aided design software to create blueprints and specifications for construction projects.In addition t
                designing and constructing infrastructure, civil engineers are also involved in the maintenance and repair of existing
                structures. They conduct inspections and assessments to identify any issues and develop solutions to address them.
                Civil engineering plays a crucial role in modern society, as it provides the foundation for many of the systems and 
                structures that people rely on every day. The work of civil engineers helps to ensure that these systems are safe, 
                efficient, and sustainable, and that they can meet the needs of society both now and in the future

            <p id="about" class="container1">
                Civil Engineering at SITRC The department started its operation in the academic year 2014-15 and it’s instrumental
                in providing degree granting graduate level courses in Civil Engineering with the intake of 60 students per academic
                year. Department proudly boasts the convergence of leading researchers from all over India in the teaching faculty 
                pool. Corporates heavyweights have taken the initiative to act as advisor to faculty members and hence the curriculum
                is not only research-led and cutting edge but it’s also aligned to the present day requirements in industries.Civil
                Engineering is one of the oldest streams of Engineering in the world. Apart from being the oldest branch, this is one 
                branch which incorporates expertise from several different streams including geotechnical sciences, structural
                engineering, environmental studies, hydraulics, transportation and hydrology. Clearly, this makes Civil Engineering
                – the largest stream in the engineering world.
