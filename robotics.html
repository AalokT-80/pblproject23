            <span class="title"><u>AUTOMATION AND ROBOTICS ENGINEERING</u></span>
            <p class="container2">
                Automatic and robotics refer to the use of technology to automate or augment tasks that are typically performed by 
                humans. Automatic systems are those that can operate without human intervention, using sensors, algorithms, and other 
                software or hardware components to perform tasks. Examples of automatic systems include self-driving cars,
                automated manufacturing equipment, and smart home systems. Robotics, on the other hand, refers to the use of 
                robots to perform tasks. Robots are programmable machines that can perform a wide range of tasks, from simple 
                repetitive actions to complex movements and decision-making processes. Robotics has applications in manufacturing,
                healthcare, education, and many other fields. Both automatic systems and robotics have the potential to increase
                efficiency, accuracy, and safety in a variety of industries. However, there are also concerns about the impact 
                of these technologies on employment and the economy, as well as ethical considerations related to the use of 
                artificial intelligence and autonomous systems.

            <span class="title"><u>AUTOMATION AND ROBOTICS ENGINEERING AT SITRC</u></span>
            <p id="about" class="container1">
                SITRC established a department dedicated to automation and robotics engineering under the aegis of the board of
                mechanical engineering from the academic year 2020-2021. The program has sanctioned intake of 60 and is affiliated
                to SPPU, Pune. The program will build the engineers through interdisciplinary studies encompassing computer
                engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. The department is composed of dedicated senior
                faculty members from the core field to conduct rigorous academics. Also, there will be a blend of faculties from
                other streams as per the demand of curriculum. The department has procured a robotic arm for the demonstration 
                purpose.
                Also, there are established labs for Mechatronics as well as hydraulics and pneumatics to give practical insight
                to the students on sensors and actuators. The department has nurtured a culture of closer industry-institute
                interactions. There are compulsory visits to various industries which have implemented higher level automations.

            <p class="container3">
                There are various events oraginzed at the SITRC. College events are a vibrant part of campus life,
                providing students with opportunities to socialize, learn, and engage with their communities. These
                events can range from academic lectures and guest speaker series to athletic competitions, cultural
                festivals, and music concerts.
                In addition to traditional events, many colleges have also started to incorporate more innovative
                programming, such as hackathons, startup competitions, and wellness fairs. These events aim to foster
                creativity, entrepreneurship, and holistic well-being among students.
                Overall, college events are an integral part of the college experience, providing students with
                opportunities to explore their interests, make connections, and create lasting memories.
