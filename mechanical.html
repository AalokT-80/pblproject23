            <p class="container2">
                Mechanical engineering is a field of engineering that focuses on the design, analysis, manufacturing, and maintenance
                of mechanical systems. It involves the application of principles from physics, mathematics, and materials science to 
                create and develop a wide range of mechanical devices and systems. Mechanical engineers work on a variety of projects,
                from designing automobiles and aircraft to developing medical devices and power generation systems. They are also
                involved in the design and construction of buildings, infrastructure, and other structures. The field of mechanical
                engineering is constantly evolving, with new technologies and materials being developed all the time. As such, 
                mechanical engineers must stay up to date with the latest advancements in the field to remain competitive and
                relevant. Overall, mechanical engineering is a fascinating and challenging field that offers a wide range of
                opportunities for those interested in designing and building mechanical systems that improve our world.

            <p id="about" class="container1">
                The Mechanical Engineering Department at SITRC was established in 2008 and has been working with the mission to provide
                our students with a perfect blend of intellectual and practical experiences. After successful completion of our
                program, students are affluent with knowledge to enter in their fields of fascination. Also, some of them crave for 
                higher studies in technical or management disciplines. The department has highly qualified, experienced faculties
                with academic integrity. Experts from leading industries across the state are visiting the department and grooming
                the students through interaction. Motivational discourses are arranged for the students for stress management. 
                Students are also ushered for competitive exams not only for engineering but also for civil services. Consistently
                the department has attracted faculties with exceptional potential. The students are promoted to participate 
                in technical events and competitions at state and national levels. Department has established student chapters of
                various professional societies like SAE, ISHRAE etc. The department has state- of- art laboratories with latest
                testing facilities like multi-fuel VCR engine.
