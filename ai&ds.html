            <p class="container2">
                Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science are two closely related fields that are transforming the
                way we work and live.

                AI involves the development of algorithms and systems that can perform tasks that typically require
                human intelligence, such as language processing, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI systems learn
                from data and can make predictions and recommendations based on patterns and insights derived from that
                data.

                Data science is the interdisciplinary field that involves the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
                of data using a range of tools and techniques, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and
                data visualization. Data scientists work with large and complex datasets to uncover patterns and
                insights that can inform decision-making and drive innovation.

                AI and data science are closely intertwined, with AI systems relying heavily on data to learn and
                improve their performance. Data science provides the tools and techniques for working with large
                datasets and extracting insights that can be used to develop more accurate and effective AI algorithms.

                Together, AI and data science are revolutionizing many industries, from healthcare to finance to
                transportation, and are opening up new possibilities for innovation and growth.

            <span class="title"><u>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA SCIENCE AT SITRC</u></span>
            <p id="about" class="container1">
                The Department Artificial Intelligence and Data Science started in the Academic Year 2021 – 22, at the
                Sandip Institute of Technology and Research Centre affiliated to Savatribai Phule Pune University, Pune
                offers at Engineering Undergraduate Program (UG) leading to the degree of Bachelor of Engineering (B.E),
                with an intake of 60.

                The department has state-of-the-art laboratories, computing facilities and qualified faculty members.
                Artificial Intelligence and Data Science is a new branch of study which deals with scientific
                methodologies, processes, and techniques drawn from different domains like statistics, cognitive
                science, and computing and information science to extract knowledge from structured data and
                unstructured data.AI and Data science is the current trend ruling the business world and it is highly
                paid career now. Artificial Intelligence and data science is a suitable course for those who would like
                to develop various intelligent business solutions. Big data solutions have changed the way how business
                models to be built and run. This study contributes much in manufacturing, e-commerce, banking, finance,
                transport and healthcare industry.In this course, Student will learn how to design, create and implement
                AI and DS based software solutions to solve actual business problems.
